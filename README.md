This program logs inputs and time intervals for export to a series of spreadsheets.
Useful for gathering data on farming runs in misc. video games; in this case, Fallout 76. 

With this tool I can quickly input live data to an array that then uses Pandas 
to output to excel document with the date for title. If there are additional runs 
made that day, it will append with an additional sheet. 

The intention is for this program to be the foundation of an auto-farming program, however, 
the Fallout 76 game environment makes this difficult. As a novice programmmer, I assume that
elements of this program are rather unpolished. It meets its primary purpose of 
collecting data, however, and perhaps one day it will be more. 

Also featured in this respository is a Dashboard for data

TO DO: 
- Optimize program for new farming (DONE)
- Create simple GUI with Tkinter (DONE)
- Add the dynamic updtaing spawn count (doesn't affect data)
- Change the Pandas output to be int specific (does affect data)
